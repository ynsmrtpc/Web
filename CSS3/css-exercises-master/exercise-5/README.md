# Exercise 5: Layering

Design has asked for a shadow effect on some cards that’s visible on hover. You implement it and notice a problem: the shadows appear “under” the card next in the DOM.

# Instructions

1.  Have whichever shadow is hovering appear on top of all other cards—front and back

# Rules

1.  You can’t change the cards’ background color, or body background color
2.  There shouldn’t be any “jumping” or “flickering” during the shadow transition
