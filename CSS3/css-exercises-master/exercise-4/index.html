      <h1>Don’t make fun of renowned author Dan Brown</h1>
      <h3>
        As the film adaptation of Dan Brown's fourth Robert Langdon novel,
        <em>Inferno</em>, is released, we present this appreciation of the author by Michael Deacon from 2013.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Renowned author Dan Brown woke up in his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house – and immediately he
        felt angry. Most people would have thought that the 48-year-old man had no reason to be angry. After all, the famous
        writer had a new book coming out. But that was the problem. A new book meant an inevitable attack on the rich novelist
        by the wealthy wordsmith’s fiercest foes. The critics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renowned author Dan Brown hated the critics. Ever since he had become one of the world’s top renowned authors they had made
        fun of him. They had mocked bestselling book
        <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, successful novel Digital Fortress, popular tome Deception Point, money-spinning volume
        <em>Angels & Demons</em> and chart-topping work of narrative fiction
        <em>The Lost Symbol</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The critics said his writing was clumsy, ungrammatical, repetitive and repetitive. They said it was full of unnecessary tautology.
        They said his prose was mired in a sea of mixed metaphors. For some reason they found something funny in sentences
        such as “His eyes went white, like a shark about to attack.” They even say my books are packed with banal and superfluous
        description, thought the 5ft 9in man. He particularly hated it when they said his imagery was nonsensical. It made
        his insect eyes flash like a rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renowned author Dan Brown got out of his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house and paced the bedroom,
        using the feet located at the ends of his two legs to propel him forwards. He knew he shouldn’t care what a few jealous
        critics thought. His new book Inferno was coming out on Tuesday, and the 480-page hardback published by Doubleday
        with a recommended US retail price of $29.95 was sure to be a hit. Wasn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll call my agent, pondered the prosperous scribe. He reached for the telephone using one of his two hands. “Hello, this
        is renowned author Dan Brown,” spoke renowned author Dan Brown. “I want to talk to literary agent John Unconvincingname.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mr Unconvincingname, it’s renowned author Dan Brown,” told the voice at the other end of the line. Instantly the voice at
        the other end of the line was replaced by a different voice at the other end of the line. “Hello, it’s literary agent
        John Unconvincingname,” informed the new voice at the other end of the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hello agent John, it’s client Dan,” commented the pecunious scribbler. “I’m worried about new book Inferno. I think critics
        are going to say it’s badly written.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice at the other end of the line gave a sigh, like a mighty oak toppling into a great river, or something else that
        didn’t sound like a sigh if you gave it a moment’s thought. “Who cares what the stupid critics say?” advised the
        literary agent. “They’re just snobs. You have millions of fans.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s true, mused the accomplished composer of thrillers that combined religion, high culture and conspiracy theories. His
        books were read by everyone from renowned politician President Obama to renowned musician Britney Spears. It was
        said that a copy of The Da Vinci Code had even found its way into the hands of renowned monarch the Queen. He was
        grateful for his good fortune, and gave thanks every night in his prayers to renowned deity God.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Think of all the money you’ve made,” recommended the literary agent. That was true too. The thriving ink-slinger’s wealth
        had allowed him to indulge his passion for great art. Among his proudest purchases were a specially commissioned
        landscape by acclaimed painter Vincent van Gogh and a signed first edition by revered scriptwriter William Shakespeare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renowned author Dan Brown smiled, the ends of his mouth curving upwards in a physical expression of pleasure. He felt much
        better. If your books brought innocent delight to millions of readers, what did it matter whether you knew the difference
        between a transitive and an intransitive verb?
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thanks, John,” he thanked. Then he put down the telephone and perambulated on foot to the desk behind which he habitually
        sat on a chair to write his famous books on an Apple iMac MD093B/A computer. New book Inferno, the latest in his
        celebrated series about fictional Harvard professor Robert Langdon, was inspired by top Italian poet Dante. It wouldn’t
        be the last in the lucrative sequence, either. He had all the sequels mapped out. The Mozart Acrostic. The Michelangelo
        Wordsearch. The Newton Sudoku.

        The 190lb adult male human being nodded his head to indicate satisfaction and returned to his bedroom by walking there. Still
        asleep in the luxurious four-poster bed of the expensive $10 million house was beautiful wife Mrs Brown. Renowned
        author Dan Brown gazed admiringly at the pulchritudinous brunette’s blonde tresses, flowing from her head like a
        stream but made from hair instead of water and without any fish in. She was as majestic as the finest sculpture by
        Caravaggio or the most coveted portrait by Rodin. I like the attractive woman, thought the successful man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps one day, inspired by beautiful wife Mrs Brown, he would move into romantic poetry, like market-leading British rhymester
        John Keats.That would be good, opined the talented person, and got back into the luxurious four-poster bed. He felt
        as happy as a man who has something to be happy about and is suitably happy about it.
